# FizzBuzz Examples

FizzBuzz is a simple programming exercise used in some dev interviews to understand the candidates ability to code basic operations.

> Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100
> - For multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number
> - For multiples of five print “Buzz” instead of the number
> - For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz” instead of the number

The outline is simple, yet it works well enough to determine how easily someone can turn thoughts into code.

### Examples:

<!-- - [Pure comparison][ex-simple] - Simple if/else logic -->
<!-- - [Word List][ex-list] - Select the right word from a list -->
- [String Slice][ex-slice] - Slice a string like an array

<!-- ### Advanced Examples: -->

<!-- - [Selecting Channels][ex-channels] - Use channels to hold the data -->
- [Single Channel][ex-channel] - Use a single channel for select
- [Branchless Loop][ex-branchless] - Loop without any comparisons in the body
- [Pure Recursion][ex-recursion] - No loop, No condition, No comparisons

### Helpers:

- [Table][h-table] - Prints a table to help with understanding bit positions
