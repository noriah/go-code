Golang code examples

<!-- ## structures

- [queues](structure/queue)
- [stacks](structure/stack)
- [trees](structure/tree)


## examples

- [strings](example/string)
- [fizzbuzz](example/fizzbuzz)
- [numbers](example/number)
  - [primes](example/number/prime)
  - [integers](example/number/integer)
  - [floats](example/number/float)
  - [binary](example/number/binary) -->

### Goals

To present various example of algorithms and complex data structures in golang. It is intended not for the code to be copied line-for-line, but for the coder to take the structure and modify it to fit the needs of their application.
