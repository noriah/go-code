# Queues

Queues are ordered collections of elements with an order of insert being their order of exit. (First in First Out (FIFO) / Last in Last out)

Queues are one way. You push to the back and pop from the front.

### Implementation Examples

- [Array/Slice Queue](slice) - array/slice implementation of a basic queue
- [Linked List Queue](linked) - collection of nodes linked together
- [Channel](channel) - using golang channels to hold data for a queue
