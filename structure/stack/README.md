# Stacks

A stack is an ordered collection of elements. You can "push" onto the top of the stack, or you can "pop" off the top.

Another name for stacks, LIFO (last in, first out), describes its order of operations.

### Implementation Examples

- [Linked List Stack](linked) - collection of nodes linked together
- [Array/Slice Stack](slice) - array/slice with counter for current position
