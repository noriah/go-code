# FizzBuzz Examples

FizzBuzz is a simple programming exercise used in some dev interviews to understand the candidates ability to code basic operations.

> Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

The outline is simple, yet it works well enough to determine how easily someone can turn thoughts into code.
